# rag_langchain_gemini
This project demonstrates an end-to-end implementation of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline using LangChain, Chroma Vector Store, and Google Gemini (1.5 Pro). It loads web content, generates embeddings, stores them in a vector database, retrieves relevant chunks based on a user query, and uses Gemini to generate concise answers.
